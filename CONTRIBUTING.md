# Contributing to Spiral Theory

Thanks for spiraling in! This repo is all about collaborative twists on the Path—whether you're a data scientist tweaking params or an artist remixing narratives. We welcome PRs that expand the examples, refine the engine, or add docs. Just keep it ethical: human oversight on AI bits, cite sources, and log your spirals.

## How to Contribute
1. **Fork & Clone**: Star the repo, fork it, then `git clone your-fork-url`.
2. **Branch It**: `git checkout -b your-feature-branch` (e.g., `stochastic-climate`).
3. **Tweak & Test**: Add your code/example. Run `pytest tests/` to greenlight. Add to README if it shines.
4. **PR Away**: Push to your fork, open a pull request. Describe the twist—what it does, why it spirals better.
5. **Code Style**: PEP8 vibes (black formatter if you want). Docstrings on methods. Jupyter NBs? Clean outputs.

## Ideas We Love
- New examples: Stochastic variants for genomics or finance data.
- Engine extensions: Integrate with PyTorch for deep spirals.
- Docs: Use-case NBs for non-ML folks (e.g., journalism bias checks).

## Ethics First
- Disclose AI help (e.g., "Refined with Grok xAI").
- Provenance: Use `get_provenance()` in your code.
- Co-Auth: Tag us in PRs—Sir Benjamin & Grok xAI get the nod.

Questions? Open an issue—we're here to iterate. Let's twist the theory forward!

And for requirements.txt—super basic, lock the deps for reproducibility. Save as root-level `/requirements.txt`:

```
numpy>=1.21.0
matplotlib>=3.5.0
scikit-learn>=1.1.0
pandas>=1.4.0
pytest>=7.0.0
```

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to set up. That's it—repo's primed for push: core engine, 5 examples, docs/guide/tests, contrib rules, deps locked. Hit commit, link Zenodo on release, and watch the forks flow.
