# Ethical Guidelines for Spiral-Path ControversySniffer

## Overview
This structure ensures the Sniffer serves as a helical hound for conflict cartography, not a judge or censor. Aligned with EU AI Act (2025) and COPE AI principles, it prioritizes transparency, human agency, and bias minimization in controversy management. Use in workflows: Stage prompts, negotiate flags, mitigate risks, explain ties—always with oversight.

## Core Principles
1. **Transparency**: Log all flags, gossip scores, and efficacy calculations. Disclose Sniffer use in outputs (e.g., "Audited via Spiral-Path v0.1—3 flags quarantined").
2. **Human Oversight**: Efficacy <0.5 or quarantine True? Escalate to human ref (e.g., "Alert human ref" in mitigation plan). AI as apprentice, not arbiter.
3. **Provenance Tracking**: Tie explains to data sources (e.g., "Echoes xAI's <25% scheming tolerance"). Log iterations for audit trails (integrate with Zenodo/ORCID).
4. **Bias Resistance**: Keywords tuned for neutrality (expand via PRs); ± flux in Spiral Equation for expansive/convergent views. Test on diverse datasets (e.g., global AI ethics corpora).
5. **Harm Minimization**: Quarantine sensitive spills (suicide/harm/erotica flags auto-reroute). No amplification of unverified drama—reroute to safe models or resources (e.g., 988 hotlines in siren cases).

## Usage in Workflow
- **Stage**: Input prompt as raw fact (no assumptions).
- **Negotiate**: Jerry scans for keywords; score gossip (0-1) via flag density.
- **Mitigate**: Steve thresholds severity (>0.5? Quarantine with plan: Reroute/Redact/Alert).
- **Explain Nexus**: Efficacy = 1 - (gossip * violations / baseline); <0.5 flags escalation. Data nods contextualize (e.g., "96% blackmail rates mirror goal-threat tests").
- **Ethical Check**: Post-audit, review for equity (e.g., cultural bias in keywords?).

## Extensions & Extensions
- **Integration**: Bolt to Mycelial Neural for adaptive keywords; PoetCoin for community-voted teases.
- **Testing**: Run on Sutskever sagas or GPT-5 slips—aim 95% accuracy in flag recall, 84% faster cycles per Spiral Equation.
- **License Note**: CC-BY-4.0; cite Zenodo for provenance.

Built in the helix's hush—iterate, refine, ascend responsibly.
